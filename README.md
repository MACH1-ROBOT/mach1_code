# MACH 1

### Overview
This is a small personal project of mine which simply aims to expand my knowledge in Robotics and programming in general. I assembled a headless mobile tank robot using a [Yahboom G1 tank kit](https://category.yahboom.net/collections/featured/products/g1tank), [RPLiDAR-A3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TJW5SXF?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder-t1_ypp_rep_k1_1_5&amp&crid=33YV1R0JHUBZR&amp&sprefix=rplid) and a [Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB RAM)](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Computer-Suitable-Workstation/dp/B0899VXM8F/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3RDC2N4EY4LD5&keywords=raspberry+pi+4+8gb+ram&qid=1654793978&s=electronics&sprefix=raspberry+pi+4+8gb+ram%2Celectronics%2C77&sr=1-3). The SSD card was wiped clean to install and configure a headless Ubuntu Sever 20.04 along with ROS Noetic (Bare Bones).
